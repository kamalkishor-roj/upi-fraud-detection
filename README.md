# 🔍 UPI Transaction Fraud Detection

A machine learning system that detects fraudulent UPI transactions 
in real time using anomaly detection and supervised learning.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

UPI fraud is a core problem for every Indian fintech company. 
Every day, Razorpay, PhonePe, and PayU process millions of 
transactions — and fraudsters exploit speed, anonymity, and 
behavioral patterns to steal money.

This project builds a fraud scoring system that flags suspicious 
transactions before they are processed.

## 🚨 Fraud Patterns Detected

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| Spike anomaly | Amount unusually high for that hour |
| Velocity fraud | Too many transactions in short time |
| Night transactions | Payments between 11pm and 5am |
| Salami slicing | Suspiciously small repeated amounts |

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language** — Python
- **ML Models** — Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Isolation Forest
- **Imbalance Handling** — SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)
- **Dashboard** — Streamlit + Plotly
- **Dataset** — Credit Card Fraud Detection (Kaggle, 284,807 transactions)

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Random Forest | 0.80 | 0.88 | 0.83 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.48 | 0.91 | 0.14 |
| Isolation Forest | 0.21 | 0.24 | 0.23 |

**Chosen model — Random Forest** because it achieves the best 
balance between catching fraud (recall 88%) and avoiding 
false alarms (precision 80%).

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

Features I engineered from raw transaction data:

- `amount_zscore` — how unusual is this amount for this hour
- `amount_log` — log-normalized amount to reduce skew
- `is_night` — binary flag for 11pm to 5am transactions
- `velocity_10` — transaction count in current time window

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

The dataset uses PCA-anonymized features (V1–V28) which cannot 
be reproduced for new manual inputs. In production, raw features 
like merchant ID, device fingerprint, and GPS location would 
replace these. The live transaction checker uses engineered 
features only and is intended as a demonstration.

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Class imbalance (0.17% fraud) is the #1 challenge in fraud detection
- SMOTE must be applied after train/test split to avoid data leakage
- Recall matters more than precision in fraud detection — 
  missing fraud is costlier than a false alarm
- Threshold tuning (0.3 vs 0.5) is a business decision, not technical

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add real UPI transaction features (merchant, device, location)
- [ ] Implement XGBoost for better performance
- [ ] Add time-series analysis of spending patterns
- [ ] Build user-level behavioral baseline model
- [ ] Add explainability using SHAP values
